  <h4><em>I'm a city girl with big dreams...</em></h4>
  <p>My whole life I have always enjoyed making things. When I was younger I was more into cutting up my clothes in hopes of starting my own fashion line. Let’s just say that didn’t work out too well. As I got older, I became really interested in arts and crafts. I found arts and crafts to be more than just a hobby, it was therapeutic for me. Not only do I love to do arts and crafts, but I also love to create my own individuality. All of my creations come from things that I have designed and implemented myself. I get some of my inspirations from my fellow YouTube and Pinterest users. Creating for me starts with a vision. I believe if you see it you can conquer it! I started this website to market my works of art. For me this is just the beginning, stay tuned!</p>
